            <h1>Hi! I'm Ichigo</h1>
            <p>
                Currently - I am a Senior at Kennesaw State University studying for my B.S. in Information Technology with a focus on the Enterprise Track. I tweaked the courses I have taken thus far to better align with my career goal of being a Full Stack Developer. For this semester I chose to take IT 4403, which is going to be used by me for this semester.  
            </p>

            <h2>Information on IT 4403:</h2>
            <p>
                IT4403 is an Advanced Web and Mobile Application course. This covers advanced topics on web and mobile applications with a focus on modern web application architectures and mobile friendly user interfaces. Students who choose to take this course will complete one major development project using currently trending web technologies. For a more detailed overview of this course <a href="https://facultyweb.kennesaw.edu/zli8/it4403.php#:~:text=Course%20Description,using%20the%20latest%20web%20technologies." alt="Link to Kennesaw State University IT 4403 webpage" target="_blank">click here</a>.

            <h2>A bit about my page:</h2>
            <p>
                This webpage will evolve into something that is more useful as we continue on this journey through the semester together. And as a bonus, the hope is that this webpage can also provoke inspiration to whoever may be viewing it.
            </p>
            <h2>The purpose of my webpage:</h2>
            <p>
                One important aspect of this class is to learn through hands-on experience by completing lab assignments, which is where this webpage comes in. Throughout the semester as we take the knowledge gained from the online materials provided to us and put it into practice, this webpage will be expanded upon and utilized to track our progress as well as be used to grade our assignments.
